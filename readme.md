```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before running the backend, the database must be set up. See [Database Setup](#database-setup)

## Repository Layout
The repository has two main directories, `frontend` which holds 
the code for the web-based frontend, and `backend` which holds
the code for the backend java server.

### Frontend
The `frontend/src` directory contains the following subdirectories:

| Directory     |                            Description                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `api`         | Contains the funtionality for communicating with the backend      |
| `app`         | Contains the pages for the website                                |
| `components`  | Contains reusable components used on multiple pages               |
| `lib`         | Helper functionality for various pages and components             |
| `types`       | Type information for API requests, as well as internal types      |

### Backend
The `backend` is a traditional maven project with the following packages:

| Package                   |                       Description                                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `org.example.requests`    | Contains the API requests that can be made to the backend server              |
| `org.example.sql`         | Contains helpers to fetch and update information from/to the database         |
| `org.example`             | Contains the main class, which is responsible for registering each API route  |

## Database Setup
To set up the database, make sure you have an instance of MySQL running.
The `root` user must have the password set to `root`, and allow connections
from the address of the frontend server.

To set up the database and required tables, the `backend/sql/databaseCreation.sql`
provides the necessary sql statements to set everything up.
